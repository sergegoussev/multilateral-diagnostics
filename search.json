Since it was first proposed by Mehrhoff (2018), it has been widely used within price statistics, from analysis of multilateral methods by Lamboray (2021) to empirical tests for the decomposition of multilateral methods by Webster and Tarnow-Mordi (2019). We leverage this dataset as it provides a very realistic example that NSOs would need to work with.\nThe dataset comes pre-categorized in separate product and movement files on the Chicago Booth School website ( ([2013] 2018)).1 This makes it simple to work with as we can assume that the category represents the elementary index prior to its integration into the CPI with other retailer dataset and field data."
